## Response Summary

Successfully created a detailed tasks.md file with 88 specific, actionable tasks organized across 11 phases:

1. **Phase 1**: Setup and Environment Configuration
2. **Phase 2**: Foundational Components and Infrastructure
3. **Phase 3**: Event-Driven Task Management (User Story 1 - P1)
4. **Phase 4**: Recurring Task Automation (User Story 2 - P1)
5. **Phase 5**: Exact-Time Reminders (User Story 3 - P1)
6. **Phase 6**: Real-time Multi-Device Sync (User Story 4 - P2)
7. **Phase 7**: Task Enhancement Features (User Story 5 - P2)
8. **Phase 8**: Cloud-Native Deployment (User Story 6 - P3)
9. **Phase 9**: Audit and Monitoring Services
10. **Phase 10**: Integration and End-to-End Testing
11. **Phase 11**: Polish and Cross-Cutting Concerns

The tasks follow the required checklist format with proper IDs, parallelization markers [P], and user story labels [US1-US6]. Dependencies and parallel execution opportunities were identified, along with an implementation strategy for MVP and incremental delivery.
